- Sunidhi Singh (GitHub / [LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunidhi-singh-08021b344/))

### Our Approach:

- **Why We Chose This Problem:**
  
  Natural disasters cause massive loss of life and property, especially in areas with poor early warning systems. I chose this problem to build a solution that can make a real-world impact by enabling timely alerts using sensor data. It combines tech with purpose—using data to save lives. 

- **Key Challenges Addressed:**
  
  - **Real-time data handling:** Processing continuous sensor data streams efficiently.
  
  - **Accurate alert triggering:** Setting reliable thresholds to minimize false alarms.
  
  - **Scalability:** Designing a system that can monitor multiple locations simultaneously.
